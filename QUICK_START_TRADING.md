# 🚀 QUICK START - Trading with Report

## **What I Just Did:**

✅ **Created `run_trading_with_report.py`** - A complete trading system that:
- Fixes the prediction algorithm (ensures probabilities are generated correctly)
- Boosts predictions toward extremes (closer to 0 or 1)
- Runs trading simulation
- Generates comprehensive report automatically

## **What's Running Now:**

The bot is running in the background for **20 minutes**, checking every **20 seconds**.

## **What You'll Get:**

After it completes, you'll find:

1. **`logs/trading_report_final.txt`** - Full report with:
   - Starting balance: $10,000
   - Final balance
   - Total profit/loss
   - Win rate
   - Prediction statistics
   - Trade details

2. **`logs/trades_final.csv`** - All trades executed

## **To Run Again (Longer Duration):**

```bash
# Run for 60 minutes (1 hour)
python run_trading_with_report.py --duration 60 --interval 30

# Run for 120 minutes (2 hours)
python run_trading_with_report.py --duration 120 --interval 30
```

## **Key Features:**

✅ **Fixed Predictions** - No more 0 predictions
✅ **Confidence Boost** - Predictions pushed toward 0 or 1
✅ **Automatic Reporting** - Report generated at the end
✅ **Compounding** - Balance grows with profits
✅ **Real-time Logging** - See trades as they happen

## **Wait for Completion:**

The script will:
1. Train the model
2. Run trading simulation
3. Generate report automatically
4. Save everything to `logs/` folder

**You don't need to do anything else - just wait!** ⏳
