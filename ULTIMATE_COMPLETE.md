## 💻 HOW TO USE

### **Method 1: As Standalone Test**

```bash
python features_ultimate.py
```

This tests all ultimate features and shows real-time market signals.

### **Method 2: Integration (Recommended!)**

```python
from features_ultimate import UltimateFeatureEngine

# Initialize
ultimate = UltimateFeatureEngine({})

# Extract all features
features = ultimate.extract_all_features('BTCUSDT')

# Use as filters
if features['mtf_signal'] < -0.5:
    # Strong bearish trend - avoid longs
    pass

if features['funding_rate'] > 0.001:
    # Overleveraged longs - expect correction
    pass

# Dynamic confidence
optimal_conf = ultimate.get_optimal_confidence_threshold(
    current_volatility=features['volatility_yz'],
    current_volume=1000000,
    avg_volume=1000000
)
```

### **Method 3: Full Integration**

Add to your `train_profitable.py`:

```python
# At the top
from features_ultimate import UltimateFeatureEngine

# After loading data
ultimate = UltimateFeatureEngine(config)
ultimate_features = ultimate.extract_all_features('BTCUSDT', df=df_btc)

# Before making trade decisions
if (features['mtf_signal'] > -0.3 and  # Not bearish
    features['funding_signal'] != -1 and  # Funding OK
    features['liquidation_signal'] != -1):  # No cascades
    # Safe to trade
    pass
```
